## Using this Repository

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the results in the article.

1. Create a conda environment with necessary pacakges.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. The spectral data can be downloaded from Materials Cloud and should be placed inside the raw data folder in the [peak fitting algorithm](1_peak_fitting_algorithm) directory.
